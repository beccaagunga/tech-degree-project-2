Mobile-first Responsive Layout


Using HTML, CSS, and responsive design, I've created a mobile-first web page with a layout that adjusts to fit mobile phones, tablets, and desktop displays.

This project was great practice using CSS. I was able to get familiar with customizing elements by adjusting margins and padding, using rem and em units, etc. I created a responsive design by creating media queries for both tablet and desktop screen sizes, which is very important in modern-day design.
